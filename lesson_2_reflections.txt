When you initialize a repository it creates hidden files which document any subsequent changes to the repository.  No commits are added, butit starts the master branch.


The staging area allows you to add files to the working directory, however if you make a mistake you can reset the directory before you commit to changes in the directory.  


The staging can be used to make sure you have one commit per logical change.  When you make a change, add the file to the staging area, then commit the change.  You can continue working on the file, adding it, and making commits incrementally.
